# Virtual Protocol Network (VPN)

## Overview
Virtual Protocol Network (VPN) is a custom-built VPN application designed to provide secure, encrypted internet access. This project aims to create a real VPN from scratch using Java, ensuring privacy and security for users without relying on third-party paid services.

## Features
- Secure and encrypted internet connection
- Custom-built VPN protocol implementation
- No reliance on third-party VPN services
- User authentication and access control
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Efficient routing and tunneling mechanisms
- Logging and monitoring capabilities

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Networking:** Java Sockets, OpenSSL (for encryption)
- **Security:** AES, RSA encryption
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Netty (for networking), BouncyCastle (for cryptography)
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL (for user management, if applicable)
- **UI (if applicable):** JavaFX/Swing

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK 11+)
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)
- OpenSSL (for encryption)
- MySQL/PostgreSQL (if using authentication)

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sushanthacharya2003/Virtual-Protocol-Network.git
   cd Virtual-Protocol-Network
   ```
2. Build the project using Maven or Gradle:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install  # For Maven users
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   gradle build  # For Gradle users
   ```
3. Run the VPN server:
   ```sh
   java -jar vpn-server.jar
   ```
4. Run the VPN client:
   ```sh
   java -jar vpn-client.jar
   ```

## Usage
- Start the VPN server on a dedicated machine.
- Configure the client to connect to the server.
- Establish a secure connection and browse anonymously.

## Security Considerations
- Uses AES-256 encryption for data transmission.
- RSA encryption for key exchange.
- Prevents DNS leaks.
- Implements firewall rules for additional security.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement GUI-based client application.
- Improve connection speed and latency.
- Add support for multiple protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN alternative).
- Implement mobile compatibility.
